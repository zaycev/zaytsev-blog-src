Hi!

![Photo]({{ site.url }}/images/vova-zaytsev-avatar-small.jpg)

My name is Vladimir (Vova) Zaytsev.

I'm a software developer at A9 (an Amazon company).  I currently reside in Palo Alto, California. My research and study background is in natural language processing and machine learning fields. I specialize in large-scale machine learning approaches for real-world situations.

I got my MS degree in Computer Science from University of Southern California. There and at ISI, I have completed several research projects working with Jerry Hobbs, Katya Ovchinnikova, Yu-Han Chang, Rajiv Maheswaran and Kevin Knight.

Here is my brief background in chronological order:

* **2014-.** Software Developer at A9. Large scale data processing and machine learning.
* **2014-2015.** Side Project – Mediator: Computational Analysis of Mass Media ([prototype](http://mediaanalysistools.github.io/prototype.html)).
* **2012-2014**. Research engineer at [Natural Languages Group](http://nlg.isi.edu) at ISI. Language understanding ([metaphor interpretation for cultural schemas](https://github.com/isi-metaphor) ) and [neural machine translation](https://github.com/zaycev/nnsmt).
* **2013.** Summer internship at A9. Spelling and search suggestions.
* **2012-2013**. Research engineer at [Computational Behavior Group](http://cbg.isi.edu) at ISI. Local events detection in Twitter ([paper](https://www.google.ie/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&ved=0ahUKEwikpZOyr6nKAhWFGD4KHedxC64QFggjMAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aaai.org%2Focs%2Findex.php%2FFSS%2FFSS13%2Fpaper%2Fdownload%2F7572%2F7561&usg=AFQjCNFqJJjgxd9v6V1qrk_Gh5_I-OTPiA&cad=rja)).
* **2012-2014**. University of Southern California: Master's Degree.
* **2012.** Side Project – Algorithms for solving vehicle routing problems with time windows ([code](https://github.com/zaycev/vrptw)).
